The way how it works is that you train the firts stage1 and that training geneartest the graph used in stage2. So you have the graph used in stage1 and then the graph used in stage2 genereated in stage1.
I provided all the necessary graphs and configs to repeat the experimetns and that is not necessary for you to train again to obtain the graphs used in stage2. You can go directly and train them and see the results.
I also provided the pretrain weights of the model leearn in stage1 for each of the different configs and the pretrain weights used in stage2.



To try stage-1 results you will find the graphs necessary in the folder setups_stage1. 


You need to change the HERE variable to your own path in the root.env file
